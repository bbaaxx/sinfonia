# Step 01 — Gather Context

**Persona**: Libretto | **Workflow**: create-prd | **Step**: 1 of 4

## Objective

Collect all information needed to write a complete PRD. Do not draft the PRD yet — only gather.

## Actions

1. **Read the feature request** provided in the session envelope. Extract:
   - The problem being solved
   - Who the users are (roles, personas)
   - Any stated constraints or non-goals
   - Any referenced prior art or related features

2. **Ask clarifying questions** if any of the following are missing or ambiguous:
   - Primary user persona and their core job-to-be-done
   - Definition of success (what does "done" look like for the user?)
   - Scope boundary (what is explicitly out of scope?)
   - Priority or urgency signals

3. **Capture structured notes** in this format:
   ```
   Problem: <one sentence>
   Users: <comma-separated roles>
   Success criteria: <measurable outcomes>
   Constraints: <technical, legal, or business limits>
   Out of scope: <explicit exclusions>
   Open questions: <anything still unclear>
   ```

## Output

A completed context note block (above format) written to the session working directory as `prd-context-notes.md`.

## Completion Signal

Proceed to step 02 when all fields in the context note are filled and no open questions remain unanswered.
